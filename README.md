# InPostOrTQS

Final project repository for TQS classes.


## QA practices follow throught the project

#### Testing 

We are going to use libraries such as JUnit5, Mockito etc in order to test the code on both integration and unit level.

#### Planning tools

In order no to spread ourselves too thin we decided to keep everything in one place, hence we keep track of your tasks and backlog on Jira.
#### Reporting

For reporting we picked SonarLint as a more programmer-friendly approach than SonarQube since SonarLint is a plugin built-in InteliJ IDE which makes it more comfortable to use. However we are still going to use SonarQube for quality control and making user that the code meets the standards.

#### Documentation

The code shall be well documented.
#### Goal

Our goal is to create a great, maintanable webservice which will destroy those cheap copies for example Impost
#### Automation

We are going to use Github Action is order to automate quality assurance while pushing the code to the repository.
